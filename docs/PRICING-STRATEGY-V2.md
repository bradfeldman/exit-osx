# Exit OSx V2 — Freemium Pricing Strategy

**Date**: February 19, 2026
**Status**: Final — approved by UX, CS, Pricing, and Product
**Stakeholders**: SaaS Pricing Strategist, Customer Success Engineering, Product Design/UX, Product Lead

---

## Executive Summary

Three-tier freemium model designed for SMB business owners ($1M–$50M revenue) preparing for a business exit. The strategy prioritizes **proof over anxiety** — free users complete real actions and see their valuation move before hitting a paywall. The primary conversion trigger is the Value Gap decomposition, reached after the user has invested effort and seen results.

**Tiers**: Foundation (Free) → Growth ($149/mo · $99/mo annual) → Deal Room ($2,500/yr)

---

## Pricing Table

| | Foundation | Growth | Deal Room |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tagline** | Know where you stand | Fix what matters | Run the deal |
| **Monthly** | $0 | $149/mo | Contact us |
| **Annual** | $0 | $99/mo ($1,188/yr) | $208/mo ($2,500/yr) |
| **Target user** | Curious founder, 2–5 years out | Active preparer, 1–3 years out | In-deal, 0–12 months out |

Annual pricing is the hero on all surfaces. Monthly exists as a nudge toward annual commitment. Deal Room monthly ($349/mo) is available through sales conversation only — not shown on pricing page.

---

## Tier 1: Foundation (Free)

**Purpose**: Create a returning user who has *proof* the platform works — not just anxiety about a number.

### Included Features

**Assessment & Scoring**
- Quick Scan (8 questions) — part of unauthenticated /assess flow

- No full Exit Readiness Report
- No category panel question-level detail (beyond Financial Health + Operations)

- No EBITDA valuation, DCF, scenario modeling, comparables, or valuation history
- No financial tools (upload, QBO/Xero, projections, tax, retirement, PFS)
- No Deal Room features

### Why 3 Free Action Items (UX Override of Dan/Alex)

Dan and Alex recommended showing only the #1 task. The UX decision overrides this based on persona analysis:

> "It is not anxiety that converts this persona — it is proof. A 52-year-old business owner who sees a scary number and a locked product thinks 'This is a scam.' A 52-year-old who completes 3 tasks and watches their valuation ticker move thinks 'I need to finish this.'"

The 3 free action items create the **investment + momentum** pattern that drives 10–15% conversion for this persona, versus 2–5% for anxiety-based conversion.

Deal Room access is valid for 12 months from activation. If a deal falls through, the user retains access for the full term.

---

## Paywall UX Specification

### Global Rules
- Never say "Upgrade to unlock"
- Never use lock icons as the primary visual
- Always show annual price as hero
- Never use urgency language ("Limited time!", "Act now!")
- Always include dollar impact when available
- Maximum 3 lines per paywall prompt
- Mobile: all paywalls render as bottom sheets, not modals

### 7 Paywall Touchpoints

**1. Actions Page — After 3rd Free Item (PRIMARY CONVERSION MOMENT)**
> "You've recovered ~$18K in business value. 9 more items could recover another ~$67,000."

Inline placement. Leads with what the user already accomplished. This is the highest-converting touchpoint because the user has invested effort and seen proof.

**2. Diagnosis — Locked Category Panels**
Inline expansion (not modal). Example:
> "Answer 4 questions to see how dependent your business is on you — and what that costs."

Focus on what the assessment reveals, not the feature.

**3. Value Gap Decomposition**
Three blurred cards (addressable / structural / aspirational). Labels readable, dollar amounts blurred at `blur-[6px]`.
> "See which parts of your gap you can actually close."

**4. Financial Tools**
Half-sheet (not modal), preserving page context. One line describing the tool's capability.

**5. AI Coach — After 1 Free Interaction**
> "I'm available with Growth — $99/month to continue our conversation."

In-context, conversational tone matching the coach's voice.

**6. Full Reports**
Report cover page with real company name and score. Content fades with gradient.
> "Your full report includes 12 findings with specific dollar amounts."

**7. Locked Playbooks**
Full title and description readable. Journey phase and category visible. Only the "Start Playbook" button is gated. When the recommendation engine surfaces a locked playbook:
> "Based on your BRI, this playbook could close $X of your value gap."

## Value Gap Reveal — Three-Layer Design

### Layer 1: Free (Foundation)
The total Value Gap number displayed prominently on the Value Home screen.
- 36px, burnt orange (#C2410C)
- Counter animation on first view (counts up to the gap amount)
- Range bar showing Current Value ← gap → Potential Value
- The user gets a real, specific, honest number

### Layer 2: Blurred (Foundation — visible but gated)
Three cards below the gap number: **Addressable**, **Structural**, **Aspirational**.
- Card labels and descriptions ARE readable (educational value)
- Dollar amounts are blurred at `blur-[6px]` (gated value)
- Below the cards: "See which parts of your gap you can actually close."

### Layer 3: Hidden (Growth only)
The OpportunityBreakdown — category-by-category cards sorted by dollar impact.
- Completely hidden on Foundation, not blurred
- Showing too many locked elements crosses from "helpful preview" to "look at everything you cannot have"

---

## Score Freshness (Not Decay)

**The score does NOT decrease. Ever.** Freshness indicator only.

| Elapsed Time | Treatment |
|---|---|
| 0–59 days | No indicator |
| 60–89 days | Muted text: "Assessed 67 days ago" |
| 90+ days | Warm amber inline banner (not modal): "Your score was last calculated 92 days ago. Business conditions may have changed." CTA: "Re-Assess Now" + "Dismiss" (removes for 30 days) |

No warning icons. No exclamation marks. No red. No score reduction.

---

## Quarterly Industry Intelligence Email

Sent to ALL tiers (including Foundation) as a re-engagement tool.

**Content:**
- 2–3 industry data points for the user's ICB classification (deal volume, median multiples, notable transactions)
- User's current BRI score for context
- 1 action recommendation relevant to the data
- CTA: "Update your assessment" (Foundation) or "View your dashboard" (Growth/Deal Room)

**Frequency**: Quarterly (Q1 in January, Q2 in April, Q3 in July, Q4 in October)

---

## Onboarding-to-Paywall Journey

### The 8-Screen Path

```
Screen 1: /assess — Business Basics (~60s)
Screen 2: /assess?step=2 — Business Profile (~90s)
Screen 3: /assess?step=3 — Buyer Confidence Scan / Quick Scan (~2:30)
Screen 4: /assess?step=4 — Review & Confirm (~30s)
Screen 5: /assess/results — Results Reveal (BRI + Valuation + Value Gap)
         ↓ [Account creation gate]
Screen 6: /dashboard — First-Visit Dashboard (First Move Card)
Screen 7: Task detail — User completes first free action → VALUATION MOVES
Screen 8: After 3rd completed action → Inline FreemiumGate:
         "You've recovered ~$18K. 9 more items could recover ~$67K."
         ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         THIS IS THE CONVERSION MOMENT
```

**Screen 5** creates awareness (the Value Gap reveal).
**Screen 8** converts from proof + investment + momentum.

Time from signup to first upgrade prompt: **2–5 hours across 1–7 days**. This is the correct pace for a $1,188/year product targeting skeptical business owners who need proof before payment.

## Pricing Page Specification

### Above the Fold

Three cards. One headline per tier. No bullet lists.

**Foundation**
> Know where you stand.
> $0/forever
> "No credit card required"
> [Start Free]

**Growth** (FEATURED — highlighted border, recommended badge)
> Fix what matters.
> $99/mo billed annually
> "Cancel anytime. Your data stays for 90 days."
> [Start Growth]

**Deal Room**
> Run the deal.
> $208/mo billed annually at $2,500
> "Need month-to-month? Contact us."
> [Activate Deal Room]

### Below the Fold

1. Value stack table (Growth): $40,000+ total value at $99/mo
2. Feature comparison table (category headers, check/dash icons, matching mocksite design patterns)
3. FAQ (6 questions): trial policy, cancellation, plan switching, security/privacy, pre-deal timing, advisor pricing
4. Trust signals section

### Mobile Adaptation
- Cards stack vertically, **Growth FIRST** (not Foundation)
- "Or start free" as subtle link below Growth card
- Comparison table replaced by expandable accordion below 700px
- Annual/monthly toggle stays visible

---

## Trust Signals (Pricing Page)

1. **Methodology transparency**: "How we calculate your valuation" link — industry multiple sources, BRI-to-multiple mapping, what the valuation is NOT
2. **Security statement**: "Your financial data is encrypted, never shared, and never used for any purpose other than your own planning. We will never contact your accountant, lawyer, or potential buyers without your explicit permission."
3. **No lock-in language**: "Cancel anytime. Your data stays for 90 days." — ON the pricing card, not in the FAQ
4. **Anonymized case examples**: "A $5M manufacturing company identified $840K in value gaps. After 4 months, their valuation range increased by 22%." No names, no photos. Industry + size + result.
5. **Advisor complementary positioning**: "Working with an advisor? Share your results with your CPA, broker, or M&A attorney." Positions product as complementary, not competitive.
6. **The product itself**: Honest scores, grounded valuations, specific action items. Never inflate scores.

## AI Cost Gating

| Feature | Tier | Cost Profile | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| ICB Industry Classification | Foundation | One-time per company | 1 |
| AI Coach | Foundation (preview) | Per-conversation | 1 interaction |
| AI Coach | Growth | Per-conversation | Unlimited |
| AI Diagnosis | Growth | Per-run (~$0.50–1.00) | Unlimited |
| AI-Adaptive Questions | Growth | Per-generation (30 questions) | Per company |
| Buyer Teaser Generator | Deal Room | Per-generation | Unlimited |

---

## Advisor Seat Strategy

| Tier | Seats | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation | 0 seats | Share Summary button generates 1-page PDF (no account needed) |
| Growth | 2 seats | View + comment |
| Deal Room | Unlimited | View + comment + edit (role-based) |

**Future**: Build waitlist for "Exit OSx for Advisors" — a separate advisor portal where advisors see all their clients, aggregate scores, and identify which clients need attention. This is the platform expansion play and potential Series A story.

**60-Day Review**: Track whether Foundation users who share the Summary PDF convert at a higher rate. If Foundation+Advisor-share accounts convert at 10+ points higher, revisit the free advisor seat decision.

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Alternative | Cost | Exit OSx Position |
|---|---|---|
| M&A Advisor (5–10% of deal) | $50K–$500K+ | "Prepare before you hire — arrive ready, negotiate stronger" |
| Exit Planning Consultant | $5K–$25K/engagement | "Always-on vs. periodic — and 10x cheaper" |
| DIY (spreadsheets + Google) | Free but slow | "Structure replaces guessing — see dollar impact of every action" |
| BizBuySell / BVR | $99–$299/report | "One report vs. continuous preparation platform" |

Foundation competes with DIY and basic valuation sites. Growth competes with exit planning consultants at 1/10th the price. Deal Room competes with M&A advisor prep work at 1/100th the cost.

---

## New Features Required (Not Yet Built)

These three items were generated during the pricing strategy process and do not exist in the current codebase:

1. **Score Freshness Indicator** — Amber banner at 90+ days since last assessment. No score reduction. Display only.
2. **Quarterly Industry Intelligence Email** — Market data email by ICB classification. Sent to all tiers.
3. **Share Summary Button** — Generates 1-page PDF (BRI score, valuation range, top 3 risks) for sharing with advisors without requiring an account/seat.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Code Changes Required
- `src/lib/pricing.ts` — Update tier names (rename `exit-ready` → `deal-room`), prices (Growth: $149/$99, Deal Room: $349/$208), add Foundation feature flags (`action-items-free` limit 3, `evidence-upload-limited`, `share-summary`, `ai-coach-preview` limit 1)
- `UpgradeModal.tsx` → Refactor to context-specific copy per touchpoint, mobile bottom sheet variant, annual price as hero
- New: `ShareSummaryButton.tsx`, public `/pricing` page, FreemiumGate updates for Actions page
- Prisma schema: Add `DEAL_ROOM` to PlanTier enum (or rename `EXIT_READY`)
